### Bastioneers
A new race mod for Stonehearth! Find this wonderful game on steam or go to http://www.stonehearth.net/

## What is it?
  Bastioneers are a curious new race to the world of Stonehearth. Commanding these little creatures will be a unique, more challenging experience than you will get from any normal old human. Should you be up to the challenge, you'll discover the Bastioneers to be quite intriguing.

## What are they?
  Very little is known about the Bastioneers. Embarking with them will be involve discovery for both you and the Bastioneers! What is known is that Bastioneers are subterranean dwellers, and they submit to an enigmatic entity named, "The Herald." It seems whatever brought the Bastioneers to the surface was at the command of The Herald. Sadly, the Bastioneers are wary of this bright new world they've entered-- wary even of you. It will take time for them to grow comfortable of you; their new commander. 
  Show them you are a good leader and they will follow you to the ends of this world!
